<h1>The Best Movies According to Me</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Transformers Trilogy (1-3)</h3>
<p>My favorite sci-fi action movie about mech battle, the CGI is beautiful and look realistic compare to current movies.</p>
<h3>Pirate Carribean Trilogy (1-3)</h3>
<p>Still the best pirate movie ever in my opninion, with out Jack Sparrow by Johnny Depp, it will be boring movie or even bad movie.</p>
<h3>Pacific Rim 2013</h3>
<p>Love the movie because how good the CGI and the story, unfortunately the second movie was bad, not even close to first movie.</p>
